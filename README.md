Hello, I'm Zinn/Golem/AngyZinn

I've started working on a Text-Adventure and am wanting to keep this nice and organized for my own sake.

Zinn.py is the 'primary' file where everything coalesces.

"Modules" are currently:
-print_color
-typeprint_module
-word_colors
-direct_low
-colors_module

These are for applying [from] commands to the primary file and loading subroutines for print_color, print_style, etc.

If you have any suggestions/advice, please go ahead. I am very new to Python.
